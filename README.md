random-album-cover
==================

This project intends to implement [this algorithm][noiseaddicts] to generate 
a random album cover.  To wit:

* [Wikipedia's random page][wiki] is the artist name
* The third-to-last [random quote][quotes] forms the basis for the album name
* The third photo on flickr's [random page][flickr] is the cover image.

This is intended as a fairly simple project which can be elaborated in various 
ways quite easily; I'm largely doing it as an exercise in learning Scala.  I'm 
trying to keep a blog up to date with notes on my progress; interested parties 
can find the blog at [timgilbert.wordpress.com][blog].
